          <h2>JavaScript is&hellip;</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A scripting language</li>
            <li>Object-orientated</li>
            <li>Distributed by web browsers</li>

                Scripting languages are languages that can be used to create small, often single file scripts
                that can perform actions. Usually executed top-to-bottom.
              </li>
              <li>
                Object orientated is a programming paradigm based on objects and their interactions. This is to make
                modelling behaviour easier as we can design the system around a real life concept. e.g. a car has two wheels
                can be modelled as a Car object with a value of 2 for it's wheels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Javascript is most commonly distributed via web browsers, many with their own <em>engines</em> that mean
                they have slightly different support for certain features. This is also what makes it common in websites
                as we known most visitors have it available simply because they are using their web browser.
              </li>

          <h2>JavaScript is <em>NOT</em>&hellip;</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Fundamental to HTML</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote class="fragment">
            Java is to JavaScript as ham is to hamster

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Often for newcomers, javascript and java are confused due to their names. That is where the real similarities
              end. they are both languages but work very differently. So be sure when searching that you are using
              JavaScript and not Java.
            </p>
            <p>
              HTML and it's surrounding languages are all individual components. CSS ties very tightly to HTML but again isn't
              necessary to view it or have a website. JavaScript is even less necessary. Many people actively disable JavaScript
              in their browser too. It's not uncommon nowadays for large sites to be un-usable without JavaScript but just a
              few years ago it was considered poor practice to rely on JavaScript.

          <h2>How to use it</h2>
          <p>The most common way to execute JavaScript is to use a <code>script</code> tag in HTML.</p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
<script src="path/to/script.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // Code goes here
</script>
          </code></pre>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              The first line demonstrates how to load or include an external file whilst the last 3 lines show
              how to write javascript directly into the tag. This is similar to CSS and the use of the style tag.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's also worth noting that this tag can go in the head of the HTML or the body. When in the head it will be
              executed before any content is actually available so a common technique is to put script tags at the very
              bottom of the body tag to ensure there is content on the page before executing.
            </p>
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h2>Programming fundamentals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Variables</li>
            <li>Data Types</li>
            <li>Functions</li>
            <li>Parameters</li>
            <li>Objects</li>
            <li>Methods</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              To really use and understanding JavaScript you need to develop some fundamental programming skills. These concepts
              are often cross functional and apply to all languages and are the building blocks of solving problems with code.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a lot here so I'm going to give a basic overview of each. When combined they become LEGO
              blocks to code that can be used to solve a huge variety of problems, not just in JavaScript but
              any other programming language.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Variables</h2>
          <p>
            Think of a variable as a bucket that can hold some information. This information can be changed later
            making it <em>variable</em>.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
var myFavouriteNumber = 26;
          </code></pre>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              All the examples shown will be written in JavaScript. This example is me creating a variable named myFavouriteNumber
              and setting it to the number 26. The semi-colon is important as it tells JavaScript that it's the end of the line.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Data Types</h2>
          <p>
            There are many different ways to represent information.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
var myFavouriteNumber = 26;  // Integer
var myFavouriteFloat  = 1.3; // Float

var myName = "Darren Coxall"; // String
var myLotteryNumbers = [10, 12, 18, 34, 52, 56, 50]; // Array
var groceryList = [
  "cheese",
  "eggs",
  "ham"
];
          </code></pre>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Data types have specific characteristics that make them better for modelling certain types of information.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>An integer has no concept of decimal places or fractions</li>
              <li>A float is an approximation of a decimal number so rounding can cause issues</li>
              <li>A String is great for text but is less useful for numeric values</li>
              <li>An Array is great for storing a list or collection of information but what happens if it's empty?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              They all have pros and cons. Also please note how an interpretted line can span multiple visible lines
              only ending after the semi colon.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Functions</h2>
          <p>
            A function allows you to create re-usable code.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
function onePlusOne() {
  return 1 + 1;
}

onePlusOne() + onePlusOne(); // => (2 + 2) 4
          </code></pre>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              A function, once defined can be called multiple times which will make it re-execute. In this example
              I define a function called onePlusOne and then I add the result of calling it twice, together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just to confuse matters, also note how a semi-colon isn't necessary whyen defining a function in this way.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Functions cont&hellip;</h2>
          <pre><code data-trim>
// a variable function
var onePlusOne = function() {
  return 1 + 1;
};

onePlusOne() + onePlusOne(); // => (2 + 2) 4
          </code></pre>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Now here you see we can actually store the function itself within a variable. When doing it this way
              you should be using the semi colon at the end of the function.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Parameters &amp; Arguments</h2>
          <p>
            Functions without parameters don't provide much flexibility. But when we can add different inputs we get
            a lot more.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

multiply(2, 3);   // => 6
multiply(10, 10); // => 100

multiply(2, multiply(1, 10)); // => 20
          </code></pre>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Within the brackets you can define the names of your parameters. In this case, x and y. These will then
              operate like variables within the function allowing you use them as if they were the item stored within.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Objects</h2>
          <p>
            Objects are simply an instance of a data type or class (a custom data type). In JavaScript you can build your own
            objects using curl braces.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
var aboutMe = {
  name:   "Darren Coxall",
  age:    26,
  height: [6, 0],
  sayHello: function(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
  }
};

aboutMe.name;   // => "Darren Coxall"
aboutMe.height; // => [6, 0]

aboutMe.sayHello("Jane"); // => "Hello. Jane"
          </code></pre>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              To access data within an object, or to call a method on an object we use what is known as dot notation.
              This is why there is a period or dot after the object name but before the attribute/method name.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>
            Commonly confused with functions. The difference is that a method has access to it's own object.
          </p>
          <pre><code data-trim>
var aboutMe = {
  name:     "Darren Coxall",
  sayHello: function(name) {
    return this.name + " says hello to " + name;
  }
};

aboutMe.sayHello("Jane"); // => "Darren Coxall says hello to Jane"
          </code></pre>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              In this example the keyword "this" allows us to use other information from the same object.
              This is an important distinction between functions and methods. Functions are stateless, they operate
              on inputs and outputs whereas Methods have state provided by the object itself.
            </p>

              JavaScript is used all over the web now in many forms. It's thanks to JavaScript that you have very rich dynamic
              services like twitter and facebook (at least in the browser) and due to the flexibility of the language it is
              quickly being used to replicate native applications but within the browser.

                DOM stands for Document Object Model. When the browser renders HTML it is building a tree of tags
                into it's memory. This is the DOM. Each tag is an object that models the the document when combined.
              </li>
              <li>
                jQuery is a popular library written in javascript for manipulating websites and the DOM. It helps to hide
                the complexity in supporting the different browsers whilst providing lots of utility functions for
                working with particular data types.

                Node is some software that let's you run JavaScript on a server. It also gives the language access

            This is the point where people start to discover what they enjoy. Building the front end: visuals; interactions; etc; Or
            they discover they like the more tangible side of things with programming which can lead to testing code; server side;
            data handling; etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a fantastic language to begin learning what can be done with programming. When combined with HTML and CSS
            you can quickly build very engaging and professional websites.
